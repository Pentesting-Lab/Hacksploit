This is only for education purposes. This can be useful for those who don't know hacking. They just wanted to give their IP and Payload Name and for  Remote Desktop (ms17_010_eternalblue) and Exploit Windows Vista/XP/2000/2003 ONLY by IP(ms17_010_psexec) needs Victims ip. After giving  those things easily you can hack. So it is very fast and easier and also makes the work easier. Even installer is also available. You can run it and install Hacksploit in your linux computer. Then you don't need to give cd Hacksploit. Just you can type hacksploit anywhere in your terminal. Then hacksploit wil start to run.
